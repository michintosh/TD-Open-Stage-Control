# TouchDesigner and Open Stage Control

This guide is for setup a basic environemnt for live performance using [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) and [Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/) to receive and send OSC messages via UDP protocol.

There are already some software that enables this kind of comunication, like TouchOSC and the TouchOSC Bridge, both of which I've personally tried and they sure do their job flawlessy.

But many people don't wanna spend money on apps for experiments, or maybe they want more customization than the one provided by TouchOSC Editor.

In this case, Open Stage Control is the perfect choice to go: it's Open Source, and it's written and compiled in Electron, which gives us some of the cool features of Javascript and CSS for styling.
